Brainstorm on how to create the app:
- Create a search field, text input field, with a button. HTML
- Display the repo name and link to the repo. HTML
- Suppress default action of the submit button. JS
- Create a function that includes the fetch method to pull from the GitHub API. JS
- Take the string from the input field and edit the endpoint URL. JS
- Clear the page after each time a search is run. JS
- Hide the results section on the first search. JS
